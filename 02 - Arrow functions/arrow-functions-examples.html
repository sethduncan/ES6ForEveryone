const race = '100m Dash';
const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];
//this is an example of an implicit return with an object literal - you put parens aroud the curly brackets of the object
//New for ES6 - if the variable is 'race' and the value is 'race' you can just use 'race'
const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];
//since we can pass a condition to filter and it will return if its true and not if its false, we dont have to use an if statement
const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
console.log(old);
